     <h1 class="body-cont">Soil acidity</h1>
    Soil acidity is a condition in which the soil pH is lower than a neutral pH (less than 7). Soil pH is a measure of the hydrogen (H+) ion concentration expressed as the negative common logarithm of H+ concentration. It is an index of the activity of H+ as it interacts with soil components, nutrients in the soil solution (water) and plants growing in the soil.
    <h1>Causes of soil acidity</h1>
Initial soil characteristics such as soil parent material, climate and original native vegetation determined soil pH prior to their cultivation. Some North soils were formed on acidic parent materials and are naturally slightly acidic. Repeated use of ammonium-based acid-forming fertilizers, leaching of nitrate-N (NO3-N) and plants taking up cations and leaving anions all promote acidification of the topsoil when cultivated.
<h1>Types of Soil Acidity </h1>
Two types of acidity occur in soils. Soil acidity determined by pH measurement during a routine soil test is known as <span style="color:hsl(240, 77%, 70%)">active acidity</span>. This is the concentration of H+ ions in the soil solution when measured in a 1:1 soil-to-water ratio mixture.
However, not all H+ ions are released immediately by the soil into solution. A portion of the H+ ions remain attached to negatively charged exchange sites on clay and organic matter (OM) particles.
This acidity is called <span style="color:hsl(240, 77%, 70%)">reserve acidity</span> because H+ can be released into solution as soil solution conditions change due to moisture changes, and concentrations of dissolved ions and salts occur. This acidity can be measured by the addition of a dilute calcium chloride solution (0.01 M CaCl2) or a buffer to the water pH suspension.
Active and reserve acidity (measured as water and buffer pH) are related but their relationship varies due to types and quantities of clay minerals, organic matter and free lime in the soil. Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), which is related to the type and quantity of clay and organic matter, influences the ratio of reserve acidity to active acidity. Soils with a higher CEC (higher clay and OM) resist (buffer) acidification better than soils with a low CEC (sandy, lower  clay and OM).
<h1>Signs of soil acidity</h1>
<ul>
  <li>	Acidic soil has a pH below 7. The common pH range for acidic soil is between 4 and 6. Acidic soil is often found in areas with high rainfall
</li>
<li>Acidic soils tend to have low nutrient availability for several important nutrients, such as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and phosphorus (P).
</li>
<li>	Poor growth and development of plant
</li>
<li>	Poor yielding due to nutrient deficiency
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Control measures</h1>
It is most important that soil acidity be treated using liming material at an early stage. If acidity spreads into the subsoil, serious yield reduction may occur. Subsoil acidity is difficult and costly to control.
There are a number of ways to minimize the soil acidification process, including:
<ul>
  <li>the use of less acidifying farming practices—considered when soils show signs of acidifications
</li>
<li>	applications of agricultural lime—applied to counter the acidification caused by cropping systems
</li>
</ul>

    <h1 class="body-cont">Soil Salinity</h1>
    
    <h1>Soil Salinity</h1>
Soil salinity is the salt content in the soil; the process of increasing the salt content is known as salinization.[1] Salts occur naturally within soils and water. Salination can be caused by natural processes such as mineral weathering or by the gradual withdrawal of an ocean. It can also come about through artificial processes such as irrigation and road salt.
<h1>Natural Occurrence</h1>
Salts are a natural component in soils and water. The ions responsible for salination are: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cl−.
Over long periods of time, as soil minerals weather and release salts, these salts are flushed or leached out of the soil by drainage water in areas with sufficient precipitation. In addition to mineral weathering, salts are also deposited via dust and precipitation. Salts may accumulate in dry regions, leading to naturally saline soils.
 
Human practices can increase the salinity of soils by the addition of salts in irrigation water. Proper irrigation management can prevent salt accumulation by providing adequate drainage water to leach added salts from the soil. Disrupting drainage patterns that provide leaching can also result in salt accumulations.
<h1>Effect of soil salinity</h1>
<ul>
<li> Excess salts in the root zone hinder plant roots from withdrawing water from surrounding soil.
</li> salinity contributes to soil erosion and increases the risk of floods.
<li>	It  lowers crop yields, and even crop failure. 
</li>	Salinity can also cause specific-ion toxicity and disrupt the nutritional balance of plants.
<li>This lowers the amount of water available to the plant, regardless of the amount of water actually in the root zone.
</li>
<li>Salinity cannot be increased to maintain soil structure without considering potential impacts on plant health. 
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Control Measures</h1>
There are several techniques to tackle salinization and inprove agricultural productivity:
<ul><li>	Increase drainage for better flushing (to remove salts from the ground surface).
</li>	
<li>Restore the balance via chemical amendment e.g gypsum or sulfuric acid.
</li>
<li>Apply fertilizer rational, as an overuse of certain chemicals promote salinization
</li>
  </ul>

  <h1 class="body-cont">Soil Sodicity</h1>
Sodicity in soil is the presence of a high proportion of sodium ions relative to other cations.
As sodium salts are leached through the soil, some sodium remains bound to clay particles—displacing other cations.
Soils are often considered sodic when the amount of sodium impacts soil structure.
Sodicity degrades soil properties by weakening the bond between soil particles.
<h1>INDICATORS OF SODICITY</h1>
Some common signs include:
<ul>
  <li></li>
•	poor vegetation or crop growth
<li>	poor water infiltration</li>
<li>	surface crusting</li>
<li>	dense or hard subsoil</li>
<li>	prismatic or columnar structure in the subsoil</li>
<li>	soapy feel when wetting and working up for soil textures</li>
<li>	pH > 8.5</li>
<li>	cloudy water in puddles</li>
<li>shallow rooting depth</li>	
</ul>
<h1>Effect of Soil Sodicity</h1>
The three main problems caused by sodium-induced dispersion are reduced infiltration, reduced hydraulic conductivity, and surface crusting.
	Soil dispersion hardens soil and blocks water infiltration, making it difficult for plants to establish and grow. The major implications associated with decreased infiltration due to sodium-induced dispersion include reduced plant available water and increased runoff and soil erosion
<ul>	
  <li>Soil dispersion not only reduces the amount of water entering the soil, but also affects hydraulic conductivity of soil. Hydraulic conductivity refers to the rate at which water flows through soil.
</li>
<li>Surface crusting is a characteristic of sodium affected soils. Surface crusting due to rainfall is greatly enhanced by sodium induced clay dispersion
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Control Measures</h1>
The use of gypsum to increase the salt content is used to manage sodic soils. By raising the level of salts in the soil, this helps to suppress dispersion. There is no defined rate to apply gypsum to ameliorate a sodic soil.
